<b>This repository contains the code for a hotel website that I built using HTML3, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap5. The website allows users to browse a list of hotels, view detailed information about each hotel, and make reservations.</b>

<h3>The website is responsive, so it can be viewed on any device. It is also well-organized and easy to use. I used Bootstrap5 to make the website easy to develop and maintain.</h3>

I am still working on the website, but I am happy to share it with the community. I hope you find it useful!
